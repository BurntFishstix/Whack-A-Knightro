Starter Project:10 Second Party Game 
Whack-A Knightro!
Concept
For my starter project, I wanted to create a game that resembled a carnival game, with a heckling barker. When researching games, I decided to go with whack-a-mole for its classic gameplay and simple mechanics. I decided to go with Whack-A Mole on a farm and theme it to Knightro for the moles. My game gives a lot of homage to UCF, with Knigthro being the title character, a Big 12 reference, and the background music being a zombie nation theme I altered to sound like an old video game. The voice lines used in the game resemble a Carnival Balker to make it feel like a true mini-game. 
Gameplay and Mechanics
	The gameplay is straightforward and only requires a mouse that can be left-click. When the game loads, it loads onto the main game screen with an announcer saying to click the button to start the game. The main game also shows a graphic of the two knight moles, showing how many clicks it takes to beat them and saying you must get a score of 12 to win! The game's code randomly places the knight moles in the nine holes, and the player must quickly get 12 points before the 10-second timer runs out. Once the player hits around the 8-10 mark, the Knightros become more challenging, and you must strike them twice to beat them fully! The way to win the game is to score 12 points; to fail is to run out of time or not score 12. 
Basic Requirements
	My game meets all the basic requirements, being a 2D single-player game that uses a mouse and lasts only 10 seconds. There are multiple clearly announced win-loss states with both audio and visual. The pre-and post-game announcements aren’t timed to be precisely two seconds, but the audio lasts around that time, and the game can be restarted at the click of a button. The code/gameplay came from a mixture of YouTube videos, unity forums, and code help sites because I don’t know how to code and find myself more of an artist. This game followed tutorials but altered the code and added/adjusted more elements to meet the requirements. 
Audio Requirements
	The game meets all the audio requirements with over three voice lines for the two end games and one pre-game resembling a carnival barker mocking the player. The background audio is an old 8-bit version of Zombie Nation, and each time you hit a mole, it makes a whack noise. 
Visual Requirements
I drew all of my sprites in Procreate and created my backgrounds in Canva with free assets, and the title logo was made in Adobe Illustrator. The UI features a score counter on the left and a countdown timer on the right. My particles appear on left clicks, obtaining free hit markers from the Unity Asset store.
